# Data Structures with Python

## What is a collection?
A collection is a group of zero or more elements that can be treated as a conceptual unit

### Kind of collections
    * Inmutable: Their length can't change
    * Dynamic: Their length can change
    * Lineal: Ordered by position, only first element don't have predecessor
    * Hierarchical: Ordered as reverse tree, only first element don't have predecessor; parents and childs.
    * Graph: Each data can have several predecessors and successors, these ere are called neighbors 
    * Tuples: Can't add more elements, can't change it, there are inmutable, tuples are designed for constant data, faster than lists.()
    * Sets: They storage no dupplicated data, fast access, logic operations are accepted, disortered, {}
