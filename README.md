# Data Structures with Python

## What is a collection?
A collection is a group of zero or more elements that can be treated as a conceptual unit

### Kind of collections
* Inmutable: Their length can't change
* Dynamic: Their length can change
* Lineal: Ordered by position, only first element don't have predecessor
* Hierarchical: Ordered as reverse tree, only first element don't have predecessor; parents and childs.
* Graph: Each data can have several predecessors and successors, these ere are called neighbors 
* Tuples: Can't add more elements, can't change it, there are inmutable, tuples are designed for constant data, faster than lists.()
* Sets: They storage no dupplicated data, fast access, logic operations are accepted, disortered, {}
* Arrays: Can't add positions, remove positions, modify their length, their capacity is defined when they are created. 
* Linked structures: It consist of connected nodes to others, there are two kind of nodes: double or simple, can't access by index but by iteration. 
    - Data: Stored value in nodes.
    - Next: Refers to the next node
    - Previus: Refers to the previus node.
